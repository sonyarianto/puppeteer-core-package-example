Puppeteer Core package example

## Preparation
I assume you already have NodeJS and npm installed on your machine.

Clone this code or fork (up to you)
```
git clone https://github.com/sonyarianto/puppeteer-core-package-example.git
```
and go to repository folder.

Install Puppeteer
```
npm i puppeteer-core
```

## Run
Just type this on the repository folder.
```
node puppeteer_core.js
```

This example will show how to use `puppeteer-core` package. A version of Puppeteer that doesn't download the Chromium browser by default. So we can use our existing Chrome or Chromium browser that already installed on our system. But be sure that it has to be compatible with Puppeteer.

Just drop me e-mail at sony@sony-ak.com or write an Issue on this repository.
